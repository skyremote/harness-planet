/**
 * The scanner, running in the page.
 *
 * On a hosted colony the server never sees the person's computer. This module holds the
 * folders they granted, runs each harness's browser adapter over them on a timer, and hands
 * the merged thread list to the game exactly as `/api/threads` would have. When the list
 * changes it also posts a small snapshot to the server — titles, previews, status, never a
 * transcript — so the same world can be looked at from a phone.
 *
 * One folder per harness, because the browser will not hand over the home directory itself:
 * `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` and `~/.cursor` are three separate picks. Cursor scans last so the
 * paths the other two have already named can decode its lossy folder names.
